## Who am I

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roan Korterink, a MSc Big Data and AI Solutions student.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to expand my skills related to python, sql, machine learning, neural networks, and much more. Besides, I am doing small side projects to my study to get more hands-on experience.

### Data Science / Analysis Portfolio
This Github repository contains several (mini-) projects I have done throughout the past few months. I did these projects besides my masterstudy Big Data and AI solutions I am following, where I work on many more projects and cases (in more complexity), and am learning on various more data science topics. Feel free to ask me more about this.

#### Content
1. Fake New Classifier - Using several NLP techniques and feature generation, I develop a classifier that recognizes fake news articles with high accuracy.
2. Sales SQL EDA - Using SQLalchemy, SQLite, I perform EDA by joining, grouping, and visualizing data, as well as testing certain hypotheses.
3. Keras Simpsons Character Classifier (in progress): creating a CNN to classify images, apply data augmentation, regularization, and transfer learning.

#### Coming soon
As I am learning / have learned how to use Keras, PyTorch, Time-series Analysis, I will be adding projects covering these topics soon. More complex projects on NLP and Image recognition will follow as well.
