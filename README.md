## Who am I

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Roan Korterink, a MSc Big Data and AI Solutions student.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to expand my skills related to python, sql, machine learning, neural networks, and much more. Besides, I am doing small side projects to my study to get more hands-on experience.

### Data Science / Analysis Portfolio
This Github repository contains several (mini-) projects I have done throughout the past few months. I did these projects besides my masterstudy Big Data and AI solutions I am following, where I work on many more projects and cases (in more complexity), and am learning on various more data science topics. Feel free to ask me more about this.

#### Content
1. Digits Recognition - I developed some simple classifiers and apply feature reduction techniques on the well-known MNIST Digits dataset.
2. Fake New Classifier - Using several NLP pre-processing techniques and different algorithms, I develop a classifier that recognizes fake news articles.
3. Sales SQL exploration - Using SQLalchemy I perform EDA by querying data and joining two datasets.
4. Other - several other smaller projects.

#### Coming soon
As I am learning / have learned how to use Keras, PyTorch, Time-series Analysis, I will be adding projects covering these topics soon. More complex projects on NLP and Image recognition will follow as well.
